Game Design Document
1.	Write the title of your project.
Ans: The Virus Run

2.	What is the goal of the game? 
Ans: A small parody (kind of) of the current situation & dodging it by using html elements like masks, sanitizers.

3.	Write a brief story of your game
Ans: There are 2 players, there are different types of elements – masks, sanitizers, injection, immunity booster on both sides of the screen. The player is running to get the vaccine from a point while trying to escape the virus. As the score increases, the player goes faster and faster. The elements on the either side of the screen help the player repel the virus for some time. Each time the player uses a sanitizer or mask his/her score decreases by 10. And if the player comes in contact with the virus more than four times, it loses. So, technically it has lives. The first player who reaches the virus wins the game.

How do you plan to make your game engaging? 
Ans: It is going to be an adaptive game, like I mentioned above. As the score increases, the player goes faster and it is also going to be a bit competitiveness as the player can see his/her friend racing towards the vaccine too.
